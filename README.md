# Simple Drone File Manager

A file manager for drones exposing public directory ROS2 bags (mcaps), video, and laz files for easy download.

## but how do I...???!!!

```sh
git clone git@github.com:robotics-88/simple-drone-file-manager.git
cd simple-drone-file-manager
npm install
```

Then you will need to create a `.env` file.
The values are up to you!
```
PUBLIC_DIRECTORY='/home/your-username/public'
PORT=9999
```
Then run with `npm start` and connect!
